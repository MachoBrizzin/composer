The following programs have been included alongside Composer as "helper" programs.
Their binaries and any necessary data can be found in the "Helpers" directory.

Without these programs, all that Composer is able to do is parse and extract the game's .pck files.
Most of the magic happens with these utilities, and their developers deserve respect.

The developer(s) of Composer do NOT take ANY credit whatsoever for any of these programs.
They were all completely developed by third parties not connected with any Composer developer in any way.
